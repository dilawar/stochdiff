/**
 *
 * Species and reactions
 *
 * <p>
 * The ReactionTable class covers everything needed about the reacting species and their
 * reactions.
 *
 * It is all implemented in primitive arrays (ie, not objects) partly for efficiency, and
 * partly for ease of conversion/compilation in c or c++.
 *
 * The table holds the data, and also has methods to evaluate functions using the data, such
 * as the reaction rate matrix.
 * Should probably also include stochastic next reaction time calculations when implememted.
